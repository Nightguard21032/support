### Step-by-step claiming
1. On the GUI at the top of the screen, click the settings icon.
2. Once the Staff Panel has opened, click "Shifts" from the menu on the left.
3. To claim a shift, click the "Start Shift" button within the Shifts menu.

### Joining & Leaving during a shift
- Before claiming a shift, make sure you have a good internet connection and can remain at the store for at least 35 minutes.
- Each shift lasts for 30 minutes, if you know you cannot stay for the entire shift, do not claim it.
- If you lose connection or disconnect, the shift will be announced as concluded within #session-notice. However, the shift can continue once you rejoin.
- **Do not reclaim the shift if you disconnect.** Reclaiming will send another announcement and restart the shift timer.
- If you reclaim a shift, there may be consequences for the disruption it can cause.
