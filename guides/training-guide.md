This guide is intended for Store Manager+. 

The purpose of this guide is to teach Store Manager+ what to do at training sessions and what to say when teaching Low Ranks. 

* The text in *italic* is meant for you to say in-game. 
  * (Copy and paste in-game).
* The text in **bold** or normal are instructions of what you should do during a training. 
  * (**DO NOT** copy and paste in-game).

## Training Information
If you decide to host a training, you must consider the following information:

Trainings can only be hosted at the following times:

| Training Times     | 
|:-------------|
| 10AM EST (Only on weekends).           | 
| 12PM EST (Only on weekends). | 
| 2PM EST           | 
| 4PM EST           | 
| 7PM EST          |
| 9PM EST           |
| 11PM EST           |


* Hosting at any other time is prohibited (unless you have permission from a Head Moderator+), and will result in the appropriate disciplinary actions.
* To host a training, you must claim a session one day prior to the day you want to host. You do not need to be in the game until :30. When in-game, make sure to use the GUI to set yourself as the Host. 
    - **If you go into the training game and claim Host powers, and you are _not_ the scheduled host, you will receive consequences.** 
* Trainers will answer any inquiries from LRs once teleportation has been completed.
* Once the host claims using the GUI, all trainers are required to go inside the Training Center and find an available counter. Low Ranks should be seated/standing near the large monitors. 
* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your Trainees to have time to read the information you’re providing them.

## Training Scripts
The following sections contain the scripts that you will need to say in-game. Only say what is shown for your specific role. Don’t say anything if you’re not doing that job!

The Host Claims the Session 
{: .label .label-yellow }

At :30, the host, the co-host, and the rankers should join the Training Center to prepare for the session.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once you have pressed claim, the message that says “No Training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the lower ranks screen will be removed, and the session will become active. 

**_NOTE: AFTER YOU HAVE CLAIMED IN-GAME, YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE SERVER, OR YOU WILL RECEIVE CONSEQUENCES! DO NOT CLAIM IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAVING INTERNET RELATED ISSUES, THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU GET DISCONNECTED, ETC._**
