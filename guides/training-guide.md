This guide is intended for Store Manager+. 

The purpose of this guide is to teach Store Manager+ what to do at training sessions and what to say when teaching Low Ranks. 

* The text in *italic* is meant for you to say in-game. 
  * (Copy and paste in-game).
* The text in **bold** or normal are instructions of what you should do during a training. 
  * (**DO NOT** copy and paste in-game).

## Training Information
If you decide to host a training, you must consider the following information:

Trainings can only be hosted at the following times:

| Training Times     | 
|:-------------|
| 10AM EST (Only on weekends).           | 
| 12PM EST (Only on weekends). | 
| 2PM EST           | 
| 4PM EST           | 
| 7PM EST          |
| 9PM EST           |
| 11PM EST           |


* Hosting at any other time is prohibited (unless you have permission from a Head Moderator+), and will result in the appropriate disciplinary actions.
* To host a training, you must claim a session one day prior to the day you want to host. You do not need to be in the game until :30. When in-game, make sure to use the GUI to set yourself as the Host. 
    - **If you go into the training game and claim Host powers, and you are _not_ the scheduled host, you will receive consequences.** 
* Trainers will answer any inquiries from LRs once teleportation has been completed.
* Once the host claims using the GUI, all trainers are required to go inside the Training Center and find an available counter. Low Ranks should be seated/standing near the large monitors. 
* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your Trainees to have time to read the information you’re providing them.

## Rank Information
In this section, you will see an overview of each rank’s job at training sessions. 

| Job        | Description          | Eligible Ranks | Quantity |
