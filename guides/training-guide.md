This guide is intended for Store Manager+. 

The purpose of this guide is to teach Store Manager+ what to do at training sessions and what to say when teaching Low Ranks. 

* The text in *italic* is meant for you to say in-game. 
  * (Copy and paste in-game).
* The text in **bold** or normal are instructions of what you should do during a training. 
  * (**DO NOT** copy and paste in-game).

## Training Information
If you decide to host a training, you must consider the following information:

Trainings can only be hosted at the following times:

| Training Times     | 
|:-------------|
| 10AM EST (Only on weekends).           | 
| 12PM EST (Only on weekends). | 
| 2PM EST           | 
| 4PM EST           | 
| 7PM EST          |
| 9PM EST           |
| 11PM EST           |


* Hosting at any other time is prohibited (unless you have permission from a Head Moderator+), and will result in the appropriate disciplinary actions.
* To host a training, you must claim a session one day prior to the day you want to host. You do not need to be in the game until :30. When in-game, make sure to use the GUI to set yourself as the Host. 
    - **If you go into the training game and claim Host powers, and you are _not_ the scheduled host, you will receive consequences.** 
* Trainers will answer any inquiries from LRs once teleportation has been completed.
* Once the host claims using the GUI, all trainers are required to go inside the Training Center and find an available counter. Low Ranks should be seated/standing near the large monitors. 
* Hosts are required to select a trusted HR to announce training at the store.
* Trainers should not rush through the script. Allow your Trainees to have time to read the information you’re providing them.

## Training Scripts
The following sections contain the scripts that you will need to say in-game. Only say what is shown for your specific role. Don’t say anything if you’re not doing that job!

The Host Claims the Session 
{: .label .label-yellow }

At :30, the Host, the Co-host, and the rankers should join the Training Center to prepare for the session.

To claim the session, click the message at the top of the screen that says “Click here to host one!”. A GUI will pop up with a button that says “Claim” on it. **Please read the information first on that GUI.** Once you have pressed claim, the message that says “No Training is being hosted right now. Check back later!” on the lower ranks screen will be removed, and the session will become active. 

**_NOTE: AFTER YOU HAVE CLAIMED IN-GAME, YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE SERVER, OR YOU WILL RECEIVE CONSEQUENCES! DO NOT CLAIM IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAVING INTERNET RELATED ISSUES, THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU GET DISCONNECTED, ETC._** 


Pre-Training (After Host has Claimed In-Game)
{: .label .label-yellow }

As the Trainees join the server, be sure to encourage them to join you in the **HALLWAY (The long hall outside the training room).**

**Host:** *Welcome to all of our staff members joining! Please come and join us in the hallway.*
**Host:** *All Low Ranks should be standing on the red lines. Your trainer will answer any questions that you might have.*

You should keep saying the line above until the start time. Do not constantly spam it… use it when necessary.
The Host and Co-Host will stand in front of the training room doors. Trainees are to stand on the red lines against the back wall.

3C - The Training Session Commences
{: .label .label-yellow }

Once it is time to commence, the Trainees should quietly stand/sit at any of the available tables, and the MRs/HRs should be at their stations. Make sure to use /e :slock to stop more Trainees from joining.

**Host:** *Greetings, everyone! Welcome to today’s training session! My name is (username), and I am your host.*

**Co-Host:** *Hello, everyone! My name is (username), and I am your co-host for today’s training session. I wish you the best of luck.*

**Co-Host:** *Before we commence, I ask everyone to remain silent at all times. You will be watching a presentation before being trained.*

**Host:** *The presentation lasts a few minutes, and we request that you give it your full attention. This presentation teaches you vital information for your success.*

**Co-Host:** *Please note that speaking or distracting others is prohibited during this time, and you will be removed from the server if caught doing so.* 

The host and co-host will stand and monitor the Trainees and the presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly.

To begin the presentation, the Host must press the “Host Settings” button at the bottom left corner of their screen, and then press the button that says ‘Begin’. **If the “Host Settings” button is not appearing on the bottom left corner, they should rejoin immediately. The slideshow can only be played once. Be sure to inform the Trainees that they can click on the monitors to get a better view.**

3D - After the Presentation
{: .label .label-yellow }

Once the presentation concludes, LRs are required to remain silent for the host’s instructions.

**Host:** *Thank you for paying attention during the presentation. You will now receive further instructions about this training.*

**TRAINERS WILL WAIT ON THE LINE UNTIL AFTER THE PRESENTATION HAS ENDED.**

**Co-Host:** *Trainees, please stay in your current positions while you wait to be teleported. You will be teleported when a trainer is available.*

**Host:** *On behalf of all MRs and HRs here, I wish you the best of luck in passing this training session. Trainers, please be patient until your Trainees are teleported to you.*

**At this point, the Host will teleport Trainees to trainers. Try to keep an eye on where the Trainees are to ensure you don’t teleport someone currently being trained.**

**Excess Trainers should be dismissed. _They may not act as spectators under any circumstances. Anybody who decides to idle during training should be kicked._**

**_The Trainees are to start at the CAFE section of the training room, then groups may move onto the registers._**
