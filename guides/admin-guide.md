#### 1B - Executing Commands
{: .no_toc }
When executing commands, you must take care to ensure you are doing it correctly. 

* TSA allows you to run a command by typing "/e" in front of a command. 
  * To run a command privately with the "/e" method, you need to first open up chat to run a command like you usually would. Before running the command, however, you need to type "/e."
    * EX:  **_/e :m Hello!_**
  * This will make the command private, and this hidden from the chat. 
* You may also use the console to carry out a command. 
  * To use the console, you need to first press ";" or "'" on your keyboard. This will cause a GUI to appear at the top of your screen. When using the console, the prefix is **not** required. 
    * EX: ; (Console Opens) 
      **_exploit logs_**

      ( Exploit logs GUI is then shown as expected) 
      
### 2 - Anti-Exploit
