# HR Promotions 

 ## Promotions
{: .text-red-300 }

The fastest way to earn a promotion is by taking an example of other HRs who got promoted thorough working hard, be mature, don’t hint in any way and be active, professional and use grammar at all times, and also, help others while you can, for example: take over trainings, help them by any chance and be a role model for lower ranks

If you bought your rank (points or by the donation bot) your chance of getting promoted will be very very low, It’s a very rare occasion that rank buyers do get promoted. I’d suggest not to buy your rank and work your way up trough hard work and dedication.

 ## Demotions
{: .text-red-300 }

If you see someone getting demoted by a Senior High Rank, do not attempt to question us or anyone “Why did they get demoted?” and do not comment the demotion for example: “omg…” or “….”. This is just very unprofessional and lower your chances of getting a promotion. If you continue taking those actions listed above you will face a punishment.
