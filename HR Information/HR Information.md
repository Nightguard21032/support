 # HR Information

This guide is intended for high ranks.
Below is some important information you need to know as a HR.

##Communication in BloxStreet
{: .text-red-300 }

### Leaking

Leaking will result in consequences and can lead to a pban. If you find someone leaking, report that in a ticket to a SHR immediately.
Leaking includes referencing chat names, sending screenshots or information from chats, sharing confidential information, and sharing links to documents that lower ranks can not access normally in public chats.

### Gossiping

•   Gossiping is when someone talks about an individual negatively behind their backs.
•   Gossiping about SHRs or staff members is prohibited.
•   If caught, gossiping will result in an instant termination and unappealable permanent ban. 

### Suicidal Thoughts/Actions

•  Please refrain from discussing suicide or self-harm in the BloxStreet Discord or in DMs with a community member. Some may find this upsetting or distressing.
• We are mostly teenagers and not qualified to help with these issues. Please talk to a professional or someone you trust instead.
• You may go on inactivity notice to take a break from BloxStreet. 


# Conduct on BloxStreet Games

•  While in a BloxStreet game, behavior matters! Acting unprofessionally has a bad look on our group and HR team.
•  All HRs are expected to utilize proper grammar on BloxStreet games.
•  All HRs are expected to behave professionally. 
•  All HRs are expected to handle situations calmly and to the best of their abilities.
•  HRs should not have off-topic conversations while in a BloxStreet game. You have direct messages and chats for that.
•  HRs may not abuse any special permissions (i.e. announcement feature).
•  These rules apply to public and private servers.


## Rule Breaking at Other Establishments
{: .text-red-300 }

Please remember that trolling, exploiting or some sort of rule breaking at other establishments, no matter if it’s an alliance group or not, will not be tolerated. If you’re caught doing so, you will be demoted/fired/blacklisted/pbanned depending on the severity of your actions. You have to follow all rules and regulations when joining Roblox games other than BloxStreet games. Please remember to behave as it could damage our group’s reputation when breaking rules at other establishments.


## Rank Purchasing

•  If someone DMs you saying they purchased a rank, do not rank them.
•  Inform them to create a ticket.
•  Ranking the player or/and dealing with this type of situation results in consequences.

 ## Promotions
{: .text-red-300 }

The fastest way to earn a promotion is by taking an example of other HRs who got promoted thorough working hard, be mature, don’t hint in any way and be active, professional and use grammar at all times, and also, help others while you can, for example: take over trainings, help them by any chance and be a role model for lower ranks

If you bought your rank (points or by the donation bot) your chance of getting promoted will be very very low, It’s a very rare occasion that rank buyers do get promoted. I’d suggest not to buy your rank and work your way up trough hard work and dedication.

 ## Demotions
{: .text-red-300 }

If you see someone getting demoted by a Senior High Rank, do not attempt to question us or anyone “Why did they get demoted?” and do not comment the demotion for example: “omg…” or “….”. This is just very unprofessional and lower your chances of getting a promotion. If you continue taking those actions listed above you will face a punishment.
