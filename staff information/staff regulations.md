* Abusing admin, the staff panel, or any permissions will result in consequences. Refer to the [Punishment Guide](https://support.bloxstreet.store/guides/punishment-guide.html) for details. 
* Professionalism is required while in public eye. Assistant Supervisor+ should utilize proper grammar in all BloxStreet games. Behaving unprofessionally reflects badly on our group. We don't want to be known as a group that behaves unprofessionally.
* Please remember to **work** while at the store. Messing around looks badly, and also leads to an increase in unsatisfied guests. Staff members who mess around at the store will not be promoted.
* For hosting shifts and trainings:
  *  **Store Director+ can host training sessions**
  *  **Store Manager+ can train at training sessions**
  *  **Assistant Director+ can host shifts**
  *  **Store Director+ can supervise the store**
