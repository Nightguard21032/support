## Rank Purchase Policy
{:.text-red-300}
Thank you for purchasing a rank at BloxStreet - your donation is appreciated. As a thank you from us, you receive a rank, depending on the amount of points you used. 

**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Lying about rank purchases through points will result in a **staff blacklist.** 
* Abusing will result in consequences. 
* You still need to follow all of our rules. If you don't, you'll be subject to the same moderation action as everyone else, including demotions, blacklists, and permanent bans.
* Purchasing **Store Executive** will significantly decrease your chances to be promoted to Junior Moderator. Everyone promoted to this role is background checked, so we will know if you bought the rank.

## Reclaiming Policy
{:.text-red-300}
If you are **demoted** or **blacklisted** for any reason, reclaiming a rank immediately after facing consequences will lead to a **permanent ban.** If you would like to appeal a staff blacklist, you may read more [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeP_tOjFug8pv5pd31Yf5JHdCKfwJi1cgx2pLFKd67W5w2r-A/viewform).

## Strike Policy
{:.text-red-300}
**Please note the following:**
{:.text-red-000}
* Only **Junior Moderator+** can hand out strikes. 
* Strikes are **permanent.** Once assigned, they can not be removed.
* Recieving **three** strikes is a demotion. 
* If you get demoted, you are free to work your way back up!
