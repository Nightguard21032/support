## Trainee Team Member-Senior Team Member
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a Trainee Team Member, Junior Team Member, or Senior Team Member, you must attend and pass a training session. Attending and passing one training session will rank you up once.

## Store Intern-Assistant Manager
{:.text-red-300}
In order to receive a promotion as a **Store Intern, Assistant Supervisor, Floor Supervisor, or Assistant Manager**, you should attend and be noticed at a shift. Utilizing proper grammar, behaving professionally, and showing dedication will increase your chances of a promotion. Attending a shift does not guarantee a promotion.

## Store Manager-Store Executive
{:.text-red-300}
There are multiple factors the administration team looks at when promoting a Store Manager to Assistant Director. The same applies when we do HR promotions.

If you are a Store Manager+, you should remain active on all BloxStreet games and its communications server, utilize proper grammar, behave professionally, and show dedication in order to have a chance of a promotion. Junior Moderator+ can promote Store Managers at random times every day. These promotions are more difficult than Store Intern - Assistant Manager ones and often require time and effort.

## Cooldowns 
{:.text-red-300}
Most BloxStreet ranks have cooldowns. A cooldown is a period of time when you cannot be promoted.
