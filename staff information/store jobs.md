Here you will find all the ways at which you can work at BloxStreet! 

## Information 
{:.text-red-300} 

While in-game, ensure that your uniform is on and you're set on the Employees team when you decide to start working.

These commands are available for you to use while in-game:

* **!startwork** -> Joins you to the Employees team and sets you as working.

* **!stopwork** -> Joins you to the Customers team and prevents you from working.

While you are on the Employees team, you are on-duty and are expected to work. While on the Customers team, you can play as a customer. All staff members are allowed to do this.

### Register

The registers are the main job at the store. All staff must be able to know how the registers function.

**Step 1:** Customers will approach you with their items. You should greet them with a friendly greeting.

**Step 2:** When they ask to be checked out, click “Open Sale” on the register.

**Step 3:** Type in their username, then click “Finalize Sale.”

**Step 4:** Click “Robux Payment” or “Card Payment,” depending on the customer’s preference.

**Step 5:** Remind the customer to scan their Cash Card on the payment screen, and after doing so, inform the customer to enjoy the rest of their day.
