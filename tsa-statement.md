# ℹ️ | TSA UPDATE

## As of January 4rd, 2022
{:.text-red-300}

### What's happened?
{:.text-blue-000}
As many know, the TSA Discord bot was compromised due to an attack.
All in-game TSA services remain operational as usual.
The administration team has been working diligently in order to restore regular operations. 

### What are we doing?
{:.text-blue-000}
At the moment, we have taken the following steps:
- TSA's token has been regenerated.
- TSA will be offline for a short while whilst we sort out a few things on the backend.
- Support ticket and verification services will be suspended during this time.

### What's restored?
{:.text-blue-000}
All restored services are subject to change depending on how the situation continues to develop.

- All chats are now reopened.
- All shifts and trainings have been resumed.

**This webpage will be updated with new developments as we get them, keep an eye out!**
