### What's happened?

As many know, the TSA Discord bot was compromised due to an attack.
All in-game TSA services remain operational as usual.
The administration team has been working diligently in order to restore regular operations. 

### What are we doing?

At the moment, we have taken the following steps:
- TSA's token has been regenerated.
- Access to TSA's server has been restricted and resecured.

### What's restored?

All restored services are subject to change depending on how the situation continues to develop.

- All ticket and verification services are now available again.
- All chats are now reopened.
- All shifts and trainings have been resumed.
- Most channels are now restored. #official-photos and another private channel cannot be restored.
- #start-here will soon be updated with accurate verification instructions.
