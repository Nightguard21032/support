{:.text-red-300}

### What's happened?
{:.text-blue-000}
As many know, TSA has currently been compromised due to an unauthorized attack. 
The administration team has been working diligently in order to restore regular operations. 

### What are we doing?
{:.text-blue-000}
At the moment, we have taken the following steps:
- Postly and Ax have both been informed of the incident and will be able to deal with it once they are online.
- All public chats have temporarily closed.
- All shifts and trainings are temporarily suspended.
- Ticket creation is currently limited to MR and HR.
- Ticket handling is currently running a reduced service as SHRs work to resolve this issue.
- The BloxStreet store and group remain open for all!
