{:.text-red-300}

### What's happened?
{:.text-blue-000}
As many know, the TSA Discord bot has currently been compromised due to an attack.
All in-game TSA services remain operational as usual.
The administration team has been working diligently in order to restore regular operations. 

### What are we doing?
{:.text-blue-000}
At the moment, we have taken the following steps:
- Postly and Ax have both been informed of the incident and will be able to deal with it once they are online.
- All public channels have been locked.
- Support ticket creation is currently limited to MRs and HRs.
- Ticket handling is currently running a reduced service as SHRs work to resolve this issue.
- Verification into the Discord server is currently suspended.
- The BloxStreet store and group remain open for all!

### What will happen next?
{:.text-blue-000}
- Once Ax or Postly is online, we will be able to restore full service to our Discord server.

### What's restored?
All restored services are subject to change depending on how the situation continues to develop.

- All shifts and trainings have been resumed.

**This webpage will be updated with new developments as we get them, keep an eye out!**
